# kardia-digitization
 A tool to convert kardia mobile pdfs into a list of numbers from the ecg signal. I modified the ECG-Digitization repository by ritikajha to make it work with the pdfs generated by the Kardia mobile app

Original digitization repository:
https://github.com/ritikajha/ECG-Digitization/tree/main

This is my first public repo that I intend for others to use, let me know of any sociable adjustments I can make.
